About the Mission File Version of DZAI: Use these instructions to convert the DZAI install package for compatibility with your mission pbo if you are unable to edit your dayz_server.pbo


What you need:
----------------------------------------------------
- cpbo* or PBO Manager**.
- A text editor (Notepad++ is recommended).
- Access to your mission .pbo.
- A downloaded copy of DZAI

* cpbo can be downloaded as part of the Arma Tools package here: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=411
** PBO Manager can be downloaded here: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=16369


Basic Installation Guide:
----------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack your mission pbo. If using cpbo, right click the .pbo file and click "Extract".
2. Copy the downloaded DZAI folder from the download package inside your unpacked mission folder. In this folder, you should also see init.sqf, mission.sqm, description.ext.
3. Edit DZAI\init\DZAI_version.hpp with a text editor. Remove the double slashes on Line 9 as instructed in the file. The line should now look like this:

	#define DZAI_MISSIONFILE_INSTALL 1

4. Edit your mission init.sqf with a text editor. Add this line at the end of your init.sqf:

    if (isServer) then {call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "DZAI\dzai_initserver.sqf";};

5. Optionally, you may edit DZAI's settings in DZAI\init\dzai_config.sqf

6. Repack your mission pbo by right-clicking the unpacked folder, then click on "create PBO". If prompted to overwrite, click "Yes".

Note: You may store your custom settings changes in DZAI\DZAI_settings_override.sqf. This file is a convenient way to store and transfer your custom settings when upgrading to a newer version of DZAI. Further instructions are provided inside this file.
